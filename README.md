========

The XAML SDK is an easy-to-use infrastructure with developer focused examples for most of the Telerik WPF and Silverlight controls.
Every control has a folder that contains the actual samples and two solutions for WPF and Silverlight. 
Every sample has readme.txt file that describes it in few sentences.
