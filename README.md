xaml-sdk
========

The __XAML SDK__ is an easy-to-use infrastructure with around 1000 developer focused examples for most of the Telerik UI for WPF controls. 

You can also install the __Telerik SDK SAMPLES BROWSER for [WPF](http://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/13-11-04/introducing-wpf-sdk-samples-browser)__. It provides a user-friendly way of browsing through the repository, automatically connecting to GitHub for updating the examples, and it gives you the ability to directly run them or see their code.

The examples for each of the components in the suite are listed in [the documentation](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/sdk-examples.html) along with a short description.

Make sure that you have a valid [telerik license key](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/getting-started/licensing/installing-license-key) included in the "%appdata%\Telerik" directory to avoid invalid license errors when running the SDK examples.
