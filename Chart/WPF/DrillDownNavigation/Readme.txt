The RadChart provides you with an API for navigating between the hierarchy levels when using its drill down feature. It can be used via the HierarchicalManager property of the RadChart. The HierarchyManger tracks the history of user navigation through data. Using its Back() and Forward() methods you can enable the user to go back through the levels of hierarchy or forward when they want to follow the same navigation line.
