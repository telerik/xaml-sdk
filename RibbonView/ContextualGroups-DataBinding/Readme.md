##Contextual Groups - Data Binding##
The sample demonstrates how to use the RadRibbonView with data-bound ContextualGroups.

SILVERLIGHT NOTE
Please note that due to limitations in SL we need to set the ContextualTabsStyle property of the RadRibbonView. That style template is different than the default one for the RadRibbonTabs, that is why we need to change its template if we use xaml binaries. However if we use NoXAML binaries you can BasedOn the style to the "ContextualTabsStyle".
