##Tree List View Bring Item Into View##
TreeListBringItem sample demonstrates how you can bring a particular, deeply nested TreeListViewRow into view. This might be helpful if you need a fast hierarchy control with many nested levels and RadTreeView is slow in your particular scenario with bring into view. This example is configured in such way that the TreeListView behaves and feels much like RadTreeView.
The first button will bring an item which is 20 levels deep with updating the UI on every level expansion. The second button will update the UI only when the bring operation is finished.
Please have in mind that running the application without debugger (Ctrl + F5 when in VS) will result in faster user experience.
