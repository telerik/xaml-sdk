The InformationLayer allows you to display additional data on top of the displayed map. This data can be in the form of simple framework elements, pin points or map shapes. As the InformationLayer derives from the ItemsControl class you are able to display more than one item in one and the same InformationLayer. You can even data bind the InformationLayer to a collection of locations. This example demonstrates the unbound mode of the InformationLayer.
