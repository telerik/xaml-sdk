#Implement Custom Commands For Map Command Bar#
It is now possible to customize the default set of commands in the MapCommandBar UI for every map provider. Every custom command should be described by a CommandDescription instance that you need to add to the respective MapProvider.Commands collection (if your custom command is RoutedCommand / RoutedUICommand, you can add the associated CommandBinding to the MapProvider.CommandBindingCollection).
