##Information Layer Map Shape Map Shape Fill##
The MapShape objects expose two specific properties - ShapeFill and HightlightFill. The first one is applied to the shapes, when they are in their normal state. The HighlightFill gets applied when the mouse is over the shape.
The two properties are of type MapShapeFill. The MapShapeFill object allows you not only to specify the Fill color, but to modify the stroke as well.

To see and run the example, please use the 'Open in VS' button and execute the project inside Visual Studio.
