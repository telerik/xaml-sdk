## External Map Mouse Location Indicator
You can use the MapMouseLocationIndicator control outside the RadMap control. In order to associate the external MapMouseLocationIndicator control and the RadMap instance, set the MapControl property of MapMouseLocationIndicator to the respective RadMap instance.
You can configure the RadMap control not to show its default MapMouseLocationIndicator control using its MouseLocationIndicatorVisibility property or the UseDefaultLayout property that disables the default layout of RadMap.

To see and run the example, please use the 'Open in VS' button and execute the project inside Visual Studio.
