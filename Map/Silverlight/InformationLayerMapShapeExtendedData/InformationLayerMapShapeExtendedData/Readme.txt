The MapShape object exposes a property called ExtendedData. It allows you to attach additional data to the shape. For example, if a shape represents a country on the map, you can use the ExtendedData property to attach information about the country such as Area, Capitol, Population etc. Later this data can be accessed through the ExtendedData property.
