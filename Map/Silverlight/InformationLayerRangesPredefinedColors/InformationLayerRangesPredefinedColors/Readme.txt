The ColorMeasureScale splits the values passed through its ExtendedPropertyName property and associates a fill color and highlight color for each one. It can automatically create ranges in two ways. For that purpose you have to use the Mode property of the ColorMeasureScale object. This example demonstrates the RangesPredefinedColors mode.

To see and run the example, please use the 'Open in VS' button and execute the project inside Visual Studio.
