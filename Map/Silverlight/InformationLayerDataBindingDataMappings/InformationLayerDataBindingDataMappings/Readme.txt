When displaying a map, you might also want to visualize some data on it in the form of hot spots, pin points, etc. The InformationLayer object allows you to dynamically load and display map markers via data binding. This example demonstrates how you can use DataMappings to configure the dynamically created map markers.

To see and run the example, please use the 'Open in VS' button and execute the project inside Visual Studio.
