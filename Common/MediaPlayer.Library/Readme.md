## Media Player ##
This example shows how to create a MediaPlayer custom control using the WPF native controls and customized RadButtons. The MediaPlayerFullscreenWrapper control allows you to show the MediaPlayer in a fullscreen mode, but it is not a mandatory to use it.
See the MediaPlayer.Example project for an example usage of the control.
