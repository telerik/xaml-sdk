## Pane Group Items Source
IMPORTANT:

With our Q3 2013 SP release of RadDocking there is a new functionality for achieving MVVM scenarios that require an equivalent of ItemsSource with the addition of PanesSource. More details about the PanesSource feature can be found here:
http://www.telerik.com/help/wpf/raddocking-features-panes-panesource.html


The example demonstrates how to extend the functionality of RadDocking with the use of Attached Properties in order to 
set a collection of Panes as ItemsSource of a specific PaneGroup for WPF.
