## CollectionEditor with Built in Data Type
This example demonstrates how to use CollectionEditor with custom data type. Built-in data types(as string, for example) does not have a default constructor, 
thus cannot be added to the Collection editor's source collection. This can be achieved by using a custom object and casting it 
to the one needed through an implicit operator.
