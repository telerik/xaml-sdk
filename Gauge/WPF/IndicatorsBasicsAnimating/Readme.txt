When the value of the indicator gets changed, it will get positioned on the appropriate place on the scale. By default the indicator will directly go to the respective position, but you are able to make this transition smoother by animating it. To do it, just enable the indicators animation by setting the IsAnimated property to True and set the Duration property to the desired value.
