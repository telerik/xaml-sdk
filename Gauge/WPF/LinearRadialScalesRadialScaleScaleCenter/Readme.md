##Linear Radial Scales Radial Scale Scale Center##
The RadialScale allows you to specify towards which point in its parent container it should get centered. This is done by using the Center property of the control. It represents a point which value is relative towards the cell size of the scale. For example, if you want to position the scale in the center of the parent container, you have to set the Center property to 0.5, 0.5 (this is the default value). This is an example where the center of the scale is 0.3, 0.3.
