##Linear Scale Tick Marks##
Tick marks allow displaying of the value intervals along the gauge scale. There are 3 types of the tick marks:

  - Major - specify the primary value intervals. MajorTicks scale's property specifies the number of the value intervals along the whole length of the scale bar. Major tick marks can have labels. You can specify the common properties and the appearance of the major tick mark using MajorTick property of the scale.
  - Middle - specify the secondary value intervals. MiddleTicks scale's property specifies the number of the secondary value intervals inside the primary value interval. Middle tick marks can't have labels. You can specify the common properties and the appearance of the middle tick mark using MiddleTick property of the scale.
  - Minor - specify the third level of the value intervals. MinorTicks scale's property specifies the number of the third level value intervals inside the secondary value interval. Minor tick marks can't have labels. You can specify the common properties and the appearance of the minor tick mark using MinorTick property of the scale.
