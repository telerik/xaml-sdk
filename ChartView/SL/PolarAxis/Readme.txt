In order to create a valid RadPolarChart object users must set its PolarAxis and RadialAxis properties to PolarAxis and NumericRadialAxis objects respectively. The PolarAxis class contains three properties and these are MajorStep, Minimum and Maximum which define the tick step, the minimum value and the maximum value of the axis. NumericRadialAxis does not define any properties specific to it.
