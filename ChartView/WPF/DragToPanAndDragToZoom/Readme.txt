The sample demonstrates the different options you have to customizing the drag-to-pan and drag-to-zoom features. 
You can use directly the DragMode property which works only with the mouse Left button. 
You can also use the DragToPanKeyCombinations and DragToZoomKeyCombinations properties to customize the key combinations which start a drag-to-pan and drag-to-zoom operation.
These properties have a higher priority than the DragMode property.
